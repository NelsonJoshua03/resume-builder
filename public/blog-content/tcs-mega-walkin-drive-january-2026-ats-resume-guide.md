## 🎯 Why ATS-Optimized Resume is CRITICAL for TCS Walk-ins

Before we dive into the preparation, here's a crucial fact: **Over 90% of resumes in India get rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)** before they even reach human recruiters.

### The TCS Resume Screening Process:
1. **Initial ATS Scan:** Your resume is first scanned by automated systems
2. **Keyword Matching:** Systems look for specific skills and experience
3. **Format Compatibility:** Complex formats often get rejected
4. **Human Review:** Only ATS-passing resumes reach recruiters

TCS, being India's largest IT employer, receives thousands of applications for each walk-in. Without an ATS-friendly resume, your application might get rejected even before you reach the interview desk.
