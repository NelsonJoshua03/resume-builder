How to Make an ATS-Friendly Resume for US Jobs from India
Introduction

Applying for US jobs from India can be challenging — not because of lack of skills, but because most resumes never reach a human recruiter. The reason? Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

US companies rely heavily on ATS software to filter resumes based on formatting, keywords, and structure. If your resume isn’t optimized for these systems, it gets rejected automatically.

In this guide, you’ll learn exactly how to create an ATS-friendly resume for US jobs from India, with practical tips, examples, and common mistakes to avoid.

What Is an ATS and Why US Companies Use It

An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is software that:

Scans resumes for keywords

Parses sections like experience, skills, and education

Ranks candidates before a recruiter reviews them

📌 Over 98% of Fortune 500 companies use ATS — including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and consulting firms like WSP, Mott MacDonald, and Burns & McDonnell.

If your resume isn’t ATS-compatible, it won’t matter how good your experience is.

Key Differences Between Indian and US Resume Standards
Aspect	Indian Resume	US Resume
Length	2–4 pages	1–2 pages
Photo	Common	❌ Not allowed
Personal Details	DOB, gender, marital status	❌ Not included
Language	Generic	Quantified & results-focused
Format	Tables, graphics	Simple, text-based

👉 US resumes focus on impact, numbers, and keywords — not design.

How to Use Keywords the Right Way
