# 🚨 URGENT: Walk-in Drive for Customer Service in Bangalore (17-24 Dec) - Here's How to NOT Get Rejected in 6 Seconds

Hey fresher! Before you rush to that walk-in interview in Varthur, Bangalore, read this first.

**93% of Indian fresher resumes get rejected in under 6 seconds.** Not by humans, but by ATS (Applicant Tracking System) - the software that scans resumes before recruiters even see them.

**🎯 Role:** Customer Service Representative
**🎓 Eligibility:** Freshers (12th pass minimum)

## 🚫 The #1 Mistake Freshers Make at Walk-ins

You stand in line for hours. You finally meet the recruiter. They glance at your resume for 6 seconds. "We'll get back to you."

*They never do.*

Why? Because your resume failed the ATS scan. Indian companies like Talenzen (who's hiring for this walk-in) use ATS software that:

1. **Scans for keywords** from the job description
2. **Checks formatting compatibility**
3. **Scores resumes automatically**
4. **Rejects 93% before human review**

## ✅ The Secret: ATS-Optimized Resume Structure

For this Customer Service Representative role, the ATS looks for:

| ATS Keywords | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Customer Service" | Must appear 3-4 times |
| "Communication Skills" | Mentioned with examples |
| "Problem Solving" | Backed by achievements |
| "Fresher" + "Eager to learn" | Shows growth mindset |
| "Computer Knowledge" | Specific software names |
