🎯 The 3 Deadly Sins Killing Indian Resumes
❌ SIN #1: The “Beautiful” Resume Trap

BEFORE: (My Canva-Style Resume)

╔══════════════════════════════════╗
║ [ICON] John Doe                  ║
║ [ICON] Software Engineer         ║
║ [ICON] Pune, India               ║
╠═══════════╦══════════════════════╣
║ Skills     ║ Experience           ║
║ • Java     ║ • TCS 2020-2023      ║
║ • Python   ║ • Projects...        ║
╚═══════════╩══════════════════════╝


WHAT ATS SEES:

John Doe  Software Engineer  Pune, India  
Skills  Experience  Java  TCS 2020-2023  Python  Projects...


😱 No formatting. No structure. Nothing parsed correctly.

❌ SIN #2: Missing Indian-Specific Keywords
What I Wrote	What ATS Wanted
“Know Java”	Java + Spring Boot + Microservices + AWS
“Worked on projects”	Agile + Scrum + JIRA + CI/CD + Docker
“Good at coding”	REST APIs + DB Design + System Architecture
❌ SIN #3: Wrong Format for Indian Companies

❌ WRONG — Western Style Resume (USA/Europe):

Education: B.Tech CSE, 8.2 GPA  
Experience: Jan 2020 – Present  
Location: Pune  


✅ RIGHT — Indian Hiring Format:

Education: B.Tech Computer Science, SPPU Pune, 82%, 2020  
Experience: 01/2020 – 12/2023  
Location: Pune, Maharashtra
