## Top 20 Questions Answered

### 1. **"Is my resume really getting rejected by ATS in 2026?"**

**Expert Answer:** Yes, and it's getting more sophisticated. In 2026, Indian ATS systems (used by 95% of companies with 100+ employees) now use **AI-powered parsing** that can detect:

- Skill keyword clustering (not just individual keywords)
- Contextual relevance of experience
- Industry-specific terminology matching
- Education institution ranking (for some premium roles)

**Pro Tip for 2026:** Use our **[free ATS Resume Builder](/free-resume-builder)** which is updated with 2026 ATS requirements. It automatically formats your resume to pass modern ATS screening.

### 2. **"Should I use AI to write my resume in 2026?"**

**Expert Answer:** Use AI as an assistant, not a writer. In 2026, recruiters can spot AI-generated resumes by:
- Overly generic language
- Lack of specific achievements
- Inconsistent writing style

**2026 Strategy:** Write your content first, then use AI for:
- Keyword optimization
- Formatting suggestions
- Grammar checking

**Recommended Tool:** Try our **[AI-powered resume analyzer](/builder)** that gives specific feedback without replacing your authentic voice.

### 3. **"What's the ideal resume length for 2026?"**

**Expert Answer by Experience Level:**

- **Freshers (0-2 years):** 1 page maximum
- **Mid-level (3-8 years):** 1-2 pages (1 page ideal)
- **Senior (8+ years):** 2 pages maximum
- **Leadership roles:** 2-3 pages if justified by achievements

**2026 Insight:** Shorter resumes perform better in initial screening. Save detailed project descriptions for your **[LinkedIn profile optimization guide](/blog/linkedin-profile-resume-optimization-india)**.

### 4. **"Are video resumes becoming popular in India for 2026?"**

**Expert Answer:** They're gaining traction but are still supplementary. As of 2026:

- **Creative/Media roles:** 45% expect video resumes
- **Tech roles:** 15% consider them
- **Corporate roles:** 5% use them

**Better Approach:** Create a strong traditional resume first using our **[professional resume builder](/professional-resume-builder)**, then add a video link in your LinkedIn profile.

### 5. **"How important are certifications in 2026 resumes?"**

**Expert Answer:** Critical for certain roles:

| Certification Type | Importance in 2026 |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP) | Very High (80% of tech roles) |
| Data Science/AI | Very High (75% of analytics roles) |
| Project Management (PMP) | High (60% of corporate roles) |
| Digital Marketing | Medium-High (varies by industry) |
| Generic online courses | Low (unless from premium platforms) |

**2026 Recommendation:** List only **relevant certifications** with completion dates. Check our **[industry-specific resume guides](/job-disciplines)** for role-specific advice.

### 6. **"Should I include my photo on an Indian resume in 2026?"**

**Expert Answer:** Generally **NO**, with exceptions:

- **Modeling/Acting roles:** Required
- **Hospitality/Client-facing roles:** Optional
- **Corporate/IT roles:** Not recommended (to avoid unconscious bias)

**2026 Update:** Most Indian MNCs have moved to photo-blind recruitment. Focus on showcasing your skills instead.

### 7. **"How do I handle employment gaps in 2026?"**

**Expert Answer:** Be transparent but strategic:

**For gaps < 6 months:**
- Use years only (2023-2024 instead of months)
- No explanation needed

**For gaps 6-12 months:**
- Add as a separate line: "Career Break: Skill Development"
- Mention any courses/certifications completed

**For gaps > 12 months:**
- Frame positively: "Professional Development Period"
- Highlight freelance/consulting work

**Pro Tip:** Use our **[resume gap explanation templates](/edit)** in our resume builder.

### 8. **"What font and format work best for Indian ATS in 2026?"**

**Expert Answer:**

| Font | ATS Compatibility | Readability |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Calibri** | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Arial** | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Times New Roman** | Good | Good |
| **Helvetica** | Good | Excellent |

**2026 Trend:** **Hybrid summaries** that combine skills + achievements + career goals.
