## 🧩 Ideal Resume Structure for Freshers

### 1️⃣ Header (Personal Details)
Include:
- Full Name  
- Phone Number  
- Professional Email ID  
- LinkedIn Profile (optional but recommended)  
- Location (City & State only)

❌ Avoid adding photo, full address, date of birth, or religion.

---

### 2️⃣ Resume Summary (Optional but Powerful)
A short summary can increase interview chances when written well.

**Example:**
> Motivated Mechanical Engineering graduate with strong fundamentals in design, manufacturing, and quality control. Seeking an entry-level role to apply technical knowledge and grow in a professional engineering environment.

---

### 3️⃣ Skills Section (Very Important for ATS)

List **job-relevant skills**, not everything you know.

**Example:**
- MS Excel (Basic Reporting)  
- AutoCAD  
- Python (Beginner)  
- Data Analysis (Basic)  
- Communication Skills  

Most freshers struggle to align skills correctly. A

Mention your latest qualification first.

**Format:**
