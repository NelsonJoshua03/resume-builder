# Why 90% of Resumes Get Rejected by ATS (And How to Fix Yours in 2 Minutes)

## The Hidden Gatekeeper That's Killing Your Job Chances

Picture this: You've spent hours perfecting your resume. You've tweaked every bullet point, optimized your skills section, and even paid a professional designer to make it look beautiful. You apply to 50+ jobs... and hear nothing back.

Sound familiar?

Here's the brutal truth: **Your resume isn't even reaching human eyes.** It's being rejected by a robot called ATS (Applicant Tracking System) within 6 seconds of submission.

## What Exactly is ATS and Why Should You Care?

ATS stands for **Applicant Tracking System** - software used by 98% of Fortune 500 companies and 75% of Indian companies (including TCS, Infosys, Reliance, and virtually every MNC) to filter resumes before they reach recruiters.

These systems scan your resume for:
- Keywords from the job description
- Proper formatting (not just looks)
- Relevant experience markers
- Skills and certifications
- Education requirements

If your resume doesn't pass this automated gatekeeper, it goes straight to the digital trash bin - no matter how qualified you are.

## The 7 Deadly Sins That Get Resumes Instantly Rejected

### 1. ❌ Using Fancy Graphics & Tables
**The Problem:** Creative templates with columns, graphics, or tables look great to humans but are completely unreadable by ATS. The system sees them as chaotic data and often extracts nothing.

**The Fix:** Stick to clean, single-column layouts with simple formatting. No tables for organizing content.

### 2. ❌ Wrong File Format
**The Problem:** Sending resumes as .JPG, .PNG, or even .DOC (not .DOCX) makes them impossible for ATS to parse correctly.

**The Fix:** Always use **.PDF** (if ATS-friendly) or **.DOCX** format. Our resume builder generates perfectly optimized PDFs that pass every ATS test.

### 3. ❌ Missing Keywords
**The Problem:** ATS scans for specific keywords from the job description. If you don't include them (or use different terminology), you fail automatically.

**The Fix:** Mirror the language from the job description. If they say "Python Development," don't just write "Python Programming."

### 4. ❌ Bad Headers & Footers
**The Problem:** Important information in headers/footers (contact details, certifications) often gets ignored by ATS scanners.

**The Fix:** Keep critical information in the main body of your resume, not in decorative headers.

### 5. ❌ Non-Standard Section Titles
**The Problem:** Creative section titles like "My Journey" or "What I Bring" confuse ATS. It's looking for standard sections: "Work Experience," "Education," "Skills."

**The Fix:** Use industry-standard section headers that every ATS recognizes instantly.

### 6. ❌ Over-Designing with Colors
**The Problem:** Light gray text, colored backgrounds, or gradient designs might look modern but often fail ATS contrast and readability checks.

**The Fix:** Black text on white background. Period. Save creativity for your portfolio.

### 7. ❌ Using Charts & Infographics
**The Problem:** Visual skill meters, progress bars, and infographics are completely invisible to ATS. The system sees empty space where your skills should be.

**The Fix:** List skills in simple bullet points or comma-separated text.

## The Secret: ATS-Optimized vs. Human-Optimized Resumes

Here's what most career coaches won't tell you: **You need TWO versions of your resume:**

1. **ATS Version:** Plain, keyword-rich, simple formatting
2. **Human Version:** Beautiful, designed, creative (for interviews)

But maintaining both is exhausting. That's why at CareerCraft, we've built templates that are **both ATS-friendly AND visually appealing** - solving this exact problem for Indian job seekers.

## Your 5-Minute ATS Audit Checklist

Before submitting any resume, run this quick check:

✅ **File Type:** Is it .PDF or .DOCX?  
✅ **Font:** Standard fonts only (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)  
✅ **Format:** Single column, no tables or columns  
✅ **Keywords:** Did you mirror the job description's language?  
✅ **Headings:** Standard section titles (Experience, Education, Skills)  
✅ **Contact Info:** In the body, not header/footer  
✅ **Readability:** Can you copy-paste all text without issues?

If you answered "No" to any of these, your resume is likely failing ATS.
