# How to Tailor Your Resume for Engineering & Energy Sector Jobs in India (2024 Guide)

The Indian engineering and energy sector is booming with opportunities from companies like **Quest Global, Reliance Industries, TechnipFMC, GE Vernova, and Hitachi Energy**. Our recent job drives show 50+ openings for Static Engineers, Piping Designers, Field Executives, and Maintenance Engineers. But here's the reality: **80% of applications get rejected by ATS systems** before human review.

This comprehensive guide will show you exactly how to create an **ATS-optimized resume specifically for Indian engineering and energy companies**.

## Why Engineering Resumes Need Special Attention

<div data-align="center">

**Indian energy companies use stricter ATS filters** than IT companies. Your resume must pass through:

1. **Keyword scanning** for technical terms (ASME, API 650, PV Elite, HRSG)
2. **Qualification verification** (GPA requirements, specific certifications)
3. **Project experience matching** (oil & gas, refining, petrochemical)
4. **Safety compliance checking** (LOTO procedures, HS&E standards)

## Section 1: Technical Skills Formatting That Gets Noticed

### For Static Engineers (Quest Global, John Cockerill):
```javascript
// CORRECT FORMAT:
Technical Skills:
• Pressure Vessel Design: ASME Section VIII, API 650
• Analysis Software: PV Elite, COMPRESS, AutoPIPE
• Standards: API 510, API 653, TEMA Standards
• Materials: Carbon Steel, Stainless Steel, Alloy 20

// WRONG FORMAT:
Skills: PV Elite, ASME, API codes, vessel design

For Piping Design Engineers:

Piping Design Skills:
• 3D Modeling: AutoCAD Plant 3D, PDMS, SP3D
• Isometric Drawings: ISO generation, BOM creation
• Codes: ASME B31.3, B31.4, B31.8
• Equipment: HRSG, Boilers, Heat Exchangers

Section 2: Experience Section Optimization
Bad Example (Generic):

• Worked on engineering projects
• Designed some equipment
• Followed safety procedures

Excellent Example (ATS-Optimized):

STATIC ENGINEER | Oil & Gas Project
• Designed 15+ pressure vessels using ASME Section VIII Div.1 for LNG terminal project
• Reduced material costs by 12% through optimized thickness calculations in PV Elite
• Ensured 100% compliance with API 650 for storage tank designs
• Collaborated with 5+ global teams on refinery expansion projects

INTERN | TechnipFMC Quality Department
• Verified 200+ supplier manufacturing records using SAP/Intelex
• Identified and resolved 15+ non-conformance issues monthly
• Maintained 99.8% quality compliance for oil & gas components
• Assisted in implementing ISO 9001:2015 audit procedures

Section 3: Project Experience That Stands Out

<div data-align="center">
Project Type	Keywords to Include	Indian Company Examples
Refinery Projects	Crude distillation, FCCU, Hydrocracker	Reliance, IOCL, BPCL
Pipeline Projects	Cross-country pipeline, Pigging, SCADA	GAIL, ONGC, Technip
Power Plant Projects	HRSG, Turbine, BOP, Balance of Plant	GE, Siemens, BHEL
Offshore Projects	Jacket structures, FPSO, Subsea	ONGC, Aker, McDermott
</div>

Section 4: Certifications That Matter Most
Must-Have for Indian Engineering Jobs:
ASME Certification - Pressure Vessel, Piping Design

API Certification - 510, 570, 653 for inspectors

NACE/SSPC - Corrosion control

ISO 9001/45001 - Quality & Safety systems

PDMS/SP3D Certification - For design engineers

Section 5: ATS Resume Template Selection Guide
Based on 500+ successful placements in Indian energy companies:

Your Profile	Recommended Template	Why It Works
Fresher/Intern (0-2 years)	ATS Optimized	Simple, single-column, maximum compatibility
Design Engineers (3-5 years)	Two Column	Showcases technical skills prominently
Senior Engineers/Managers	Executive	Professional, corporate appearance
Field/Service Engineers	Professional	Clean layout with project highlights

Section 6: 7 Critical Keywords for Indian Energy Sector ATS
Include these exact phrases in your resume:

"Oil & Gas Industry Experience" - Triggers positive filters

"ASME Code Compliance" - Technical competency signal

"Project Execution in Indian Context" - Local experience

"Safety Procedure Implementation (LOTO)" - Critical for operations roles

"SAP/ERP System Experience" - Used by all major companies

"Vendor Document Review" - Quality assurance keyword

"Cross-functional Team Coordination" - Collaboration skill

Section 7: Common Mistakes That Get Rejected
❌ Immediate Rejection Triggers:
Mentioning salary expectations in resume

Unexplained employment gaps > 6 months

Generic objective statements ("Seeking challenging position")

Unverified certifications (list only authentic ones)

Poor formatting with tables/images in ATS resume

✅ What Gets Shortlisted:
Quantifiable achievements (increased efficiency by X%)

Project names and client names (if permitted)

Specific software proficiency levels (Advanced/Intermediate)

Safety record mentions (zero LTI incidents)

Willingness to relocate within India

Section 8: Resume Customization for Specific Companies
For Reliance Industries Field Executive Roles:
Emphasize "field operations experience"

Highlight "safety procedure compliance"

Mention "equipment monitoring & maintenance"

Include "sampling and testing procedures"

For Quest Global Static Engineer Roles:
Front-load "ASME standards knowledge"

Detail "pressure vessel design experience"

Specify "analysis software proficiency"

Showcase "global project collaboration"

For TechnipFMC Quality Roles:
Focus on "supplier quality management"

Mention "SAP/Intelex system experience"

Highlight "non-conformance resolution"

Include "engineering documentation review"
