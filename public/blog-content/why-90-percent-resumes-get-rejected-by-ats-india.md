## Why 90% of Resumes Get Rejected by ATS in India

Recruiters don’t reject resumes — software does.

Over 90% of resumes in India never reach recruiters due to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

## What Is an ATS?
An Applicant Tracking System filters resumes based on keywords, formatting, and structure before recruiters review them.

## Why Resumes Fail ATS

### 1. Fancy Templates
Graphics, icons, and columns break ATS readability.

### 2. Missing Keywords
ATS matches resumes with job descriptions.

### 3. Incorrect File Format
Image-based PDFs are often unreadable.

### 4. Non-Standard Headings
ATS expects traditional headings.

### 5. Long Paragraphs
Bulky text reduces keyword detection.
